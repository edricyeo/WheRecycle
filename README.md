## Idea Behind Our App

Our app helps users to:
1. Learn more about recycling.
2. Check if certain items are recyclable (by scanning the QR code on its packaging)
3. Locate Recycling Bins 

Our app has a reward system, which provides incentives to users who manage to deposit recyclable items, in good condition, into our smart recycling bins. Our smart recycling bins will ideally be able to check the condition of the materials that are deposited, and award users with points based on the condition of the recycled material. Users can check the amount of points they have accumulated using the app, and can redeem rewards from sponsors through the app as well.

By using our app and smart bins, we make recycling more convenient and accessible, since users can be notified of where the nearest smart bins are. We believe users would be encouraged to take action, if they realised it is actually not as inconvenient as they thought to do their part to reduce waste. Furthermore, with a reward system, users would be further incentivised to participate in recycling. We hope that eventually, this will inculcate the habit of recycling in our society.
